------------ 

The online learning platform in DCU is called <a href="https://loop.dcu.ie/">Loop</a>. It is where all of the lecture notes are uploaded by lecturers and each year it is cleared and replaced with the notes for the current year. At the end of the year I wanted to download all of my notes. Performing this task by hand would take a long time and is very menial so I decided to write a scraper to do this for me. <br>
Unfortunately, the notes were removed before I finished writing the scraper so I have put the project on hold until closer to the end of the year.
